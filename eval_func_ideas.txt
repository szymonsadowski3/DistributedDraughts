I would start with something dead simple: material difference. Which is equal to: (# of my checkers on board) -
(# of opponent's checkers on board).
Then you could add more features and begin to weight them, like
"# of exposed checkers",
"# of protected checkers", or perhaps
"# of squares controlled in middle of board", and so on.
Talk to a domain expert (i.e. a checkers player)
and/or consult a checkers book to see what would work out well.
